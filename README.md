# web-scraping-challenge

This repo contains project files relating to the web scraping of a mars website provided by the instructors and hosted by Edx.

The code used to scrape the website can be found in the root directory of this repository. The same is true of the CSV file containing the exported Pandas DataFrame created in Part 2 of the project.

The objective was to analyze the weather records from various weather stations in Hawaii in a Jupyter Notebook file and create a Flask app that allowed a user to retrieve that data using an API. Both the Jupyter Notebook (climate_starter.ipynb) and Flask app (app.py) files can be found in the "SurfsUp" folder within this repository.
