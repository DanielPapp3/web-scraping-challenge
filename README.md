# web-scraping-challenge

This repo contains project files relating to the web scraping of a mars website provided by the instructors and hosted by Edx.

The code used to scrape the website can be found in the root directory of this repository. The same is true of the CSV file containing the exported Pandas DataFrame created in Part 2 of the project.

The objectives are detailed below:

In part 1 (mars_news), students were to analyze the provided website's code using Beautiful Soup and extract the title and preview text of all articles on the webpage to a list of dictionaries.

In part 2 (mars_weather), students were tasked with scraping the data from the table at the provided webpage using Beautiful Soup, storing the data in a Pandas DataFrame, answering a handful of questions relating to the weather on Mars, and export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
